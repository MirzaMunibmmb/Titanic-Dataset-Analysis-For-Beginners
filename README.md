# Titanic-Dataset-Analysis-For-Beginners

This is the simple Analysis on Titanic Dataset for beginners. Following are the questions answered in the analysis of the Titanic Dataset:

  1) How many passengers survived and how many were killed (in number and %).
  2) Does survival had anything to do with the gender? (Survival vs Gender).
  3) Does survival have anything to do with the class in which the passenger was traveling and who survived more 1st class passengers, 2nd class passengers or 3rd class passengers?
  4) Which age group, survived the most, kids (0-12), teen agers (13-19), youngsters (20-30), middle age people (31-50) or elders (50 and) greater) ?
  5) Which people survived the most, either those who were traveling with the family or those who were traveling alone?
  6) Finally compare the survival rate vs gender, class, age group, and family
  
First i did the preprocessing on the Titanic dataset to make the dataset ready for the Analysis. I tried to do the same analysis by two method:

Using Simple Conditional Statements.
Using Groupby Functions.
